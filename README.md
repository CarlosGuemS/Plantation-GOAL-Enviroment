# Plantation-GOAL-Enviroment
Made by Miquel Buxons and Carlos GÃ¼emes. Project for the the Multiagent Systems Design subject at the MAI master at the UPC. The code presented here is solely for academic purposes and experimentation.

The repository consits of two projects:
* A Java enviroment which follows the Enviroment Interface Standard that simulates a plantation
* A GOAL project in which a set othen connect to it to manage it. 

The Enviroment Interface Standard is made by Koen Hindriks [(official hub)](https://github.com/eishub).

GOAL is made by Koen Hindriks and Vincent Koeman [(official webpage)](https://goalapl.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GOAL/overview?mode=global).
